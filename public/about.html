<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Niguse Geda.I’m a passionate Full Stack Developer, UI/UX Designer, and Graphic Designer based in Ethiopia. I specialize in creating clean, user-friendly web applications that combine strong technical performance with beautiful, intuitive interfaces.

I have hands-on experience developing and designing systems across various domains. Notably:

I’m currently working on a Web-Based Online Voting System for the Hossana Election Board, transitioning their manual system into a secure, digital platform.

I’ve also designed and developed a Web-Based Oromia Tour and Travel Guider system, enhancing the region’s tourism services through modern technology and seamless user experience.

My stack includes the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), along with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. I'm also experienced in systems analysis, capable of designing use case diagrams, class and activity diagrams, and workflow models for complex systems.

Beyond development, I actively prepare educational content such as detailed chapter summaries, PowerPoint slides, and question banks (True/False, Multiple Choice, Fill-in-the-Blank) — making me a valuable contributor to academic and training environments.

I’m always eager to learn, collaborate, and build solutions that solve real-world problems.
